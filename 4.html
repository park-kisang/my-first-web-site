<h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
<p>The red panda is difficult to observe in the wild, and most studies on its behaviour have taken place in captivity.
    The red panda appears to be both nocturnal and crepuscular, sleeping in between periods of activity at night. 
    It typically rests or sleeps in trees or other elevated spaces, 
    stretched out prone on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, 
    and curled up with its hindlimb over the face when it is cold. 
    It is adapted for climbing and descends to the ground head-first with the hindfeet holding on to the middle of 
    the tree trunk. It moves quickly on the ground by trotting or bounding.</p>
