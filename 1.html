<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 30px;">The origin of the name panda is uncertain, 
but one of the most likely theories is that it derived from the Nepali word "ponya".
The Nepali words "nigalya ponya" has been translated as "bamboo footed" 
and is thought to be the red panda's Nepali name; in English, it was simply called panda, 
and was the only animal known under this name for more than 40 years; 
it became known as the red panda or lesser panda to distinguish it from the giant panda, 
which was formally described and named in 1869.</p>
