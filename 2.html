<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The face is generally white. It is characterized by small dark spots around the eyes. 
It has a circular flat face with short snouts, pointed and large ears, and a ring pattern on its tail. 
The upper part of the body is rusted or brown, and the center part is very dark. 
It has sharp claws, and it is also possible to partially hide the claws depending on the circumstances. 
It has very colorful fur, and it is resistant to cold due to its long, rough outer fur and dense fluff. 
Females have four nipples.<br>

I live almost alone except during the breeding season. 
After waking up or eating, I sometimes use my tongue to straighten my hair. 
Due to nocturnal activities, I climb trees during the day and rest. 
As you go from tropical to temperate regions, you tend to have longer gestation periods due to delayed conception.</p>
